# Automated-birthday-wisher
we're going to be learning about email SMTP and the date time module. Basically, we're going to learn how to send email using Python code. And we're going to determine when we send the email using this daytime time module

We're going to build a Python program. This Python program is going to be the automated birthday wisher. All we have to do it is create a spreadsheet of all of our friend's birthdays date and then create a bunch of birthday wishes emails and we'll randomly pick a birthday wish to send to each of these friends.
